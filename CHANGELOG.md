## [0.2.1] - 2025-07-15
### Added
-   **Generic Search/Fill/Query Field Support:** The extension now detects and fills generic fields such as "search", "fill", "query", and "keyword" with random, realistic search terms.
-   **Improved Select Field Handling:** Enhanced logic for `<select>` elements to better handle numeric and non-numeric options, ensuring more accurate and varied data selection.
-   **Expanded Keyword Detection:** Broader keyword matching for address, phone, and other fields to improve compatibility with diverse form structures.

### Changed
-   **Refined Phone Number Autofill:** Phone number fields are now filled with randomly generated Ethiopian numbers when no data is provided, supporting multiple phone fields per form.
-   **More Robust Event Dispatching:** Input and change events are now reliably dispatched after autofill to ensure compatibility with dynamic forms and frameworks.

### Fixed
-   **Edge Case Handling for Hidden/Disabled Fields:** The extension now skips hidden or already-filled fields, reducing the risk of overwriting user data or triggering validation errors.
